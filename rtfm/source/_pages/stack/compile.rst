.. _CompileStack:

Code compilation
================

First things first: **using "alternative" languages is not a constraint**.
Wordless's scaffolded theme uses the following languages by default:

* **PHUG** for views as an alternative to PHP+HTML
* **CoffeeScript** 2 for JS (ES6 ready)
* **Sass** for CSS

You could decide to use *plain* languages, just by renaming (and rewriting)
your files.

Wordless functions which require filenames as arguments, such as

.. code-block:: php

  <?php

  render_partial("posts/post")

  // or

  javascript_url("application")

will always require extension-less names and they will find your files whatever
extension they have.

.. seealso::

    PHUG paragraph @ :ref:`PlainPhp`

Anyway we think that the default languages are **powerful, more productive, more
pleasant to read and to write**.

Add the fact that wordless will take care of all compilation tasks, giving you
focus on writing: we think this is a win-win scenario.

PHUG
####

Pug_ is a robust, elegant, feature-rich template engine for Node.js. Here we
use a terrific PHP port of the language: Phug_. You can find huge
documentation on the official site https://www.phug-lang.com/, where you can
also find a neat live playground (click on the "Try Phug" menu item).

It comes from the JS world, so most front-end programmers should be familiar
with it, but it is also very similar to other template languages such as SLIM
and HAML (old!)

We love it because it is concise, clear, tidy and clean.

.. code-block:: jade
    :caption: A snippet of a minimal WP template

    h2 Post Details
    - the_post()
    .post
      header
        h3!= link_to(get_the_title(), get_permalink())
      content!= get_the_content()

Certainly, becoming fluent in PUG usage could have a not-so-flat learning curve,
but starting from the basics shuold be affordable and the reward is high.

Who compiles PUG?
"""""""""""""""""

When a ``.html.pug`` template is loaded, the wordless plugin will automatically
compile (and cache) it. As far as you have the plugin activated you are ok.

.. important::

    By default, you have nothing to do to deploy in production, but if performance is
    crucial in your project, then you can optimize. See :ref:`PHUG optimizer` for more informations.

CoffeeScript and Sass
#####################

Here we are in the **Webpack** domain; from the compilation point of view there
is nothing Wordless-specific but the file path configuration.

The default webpack configuration file is written itself in Coffeescript,
because it is `natively supported`_ by Webpack and because it makes the code
easier to read.

.. _natively supported: https://webpack.js.org/configuration/configuration-languages/

Configuration is pretty standard, so it's up to you to read Webpack's
documentation. Let's see how paths are configured in ``webpack.config.coffee``.

Paths
"""""

Paths are based on the Wordless scaffold. Variables are defined at the top:

.. literalinclude:: /../../wordless/theme_builder/vanilla_theme/webpack.config.coffee
    :language: coffeescript
    :caption: webpack.config.coffee
    :lineno-start: 4
    :lines: 4-7

and are used by the ``entry`` and ``output`` configurations:

.. literalinclude:: /../../wordless/theme_builder/vanilla_theme/webpack.config.coffee
    :language: coffeescript
    :caption: webpack.config.coffee
    :lineno-start: 18
    :lines: 18-23

CSS will be extracted from the bundle by the usual extract-text-webpack-plugin_

.. _extract-text-webpack-plugin: https://webpack.js.org/plugins/extract-text-webpack-plugin/

.. literalinclude:: /../../wordless/theme_builder/vanilla_theme/webpack.config.coffee
    :language: coffeescript
    :caption: webpack.config.coffee
    :lineno-start: 69
    :lines: 69-82
    :emphasize-lines: 10

Inclusion of compiled files
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Wrapping up: the resulting files will be

* ``assets/javascripts/application.js``
* ``assets/stylesheets/screen.css``

As far as those files remain *as-is*, the theme will automatically load them.

If you want to edit names and/or paths, you have only to edit the WordPress
asset enqueue configurations:

.. literalinclude:: /../../wordless/theme_builder/vanilla_theme/config/initializers/default_hooks.php
    :caption: config/initializers/default_hooks.php
    :language: php
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 6,16

.. note::
    The ``stylesheet_url`` and ``javascript_url`` Wordless' helpers
    will search for a file named as per the passed parameter inside the default
    paths, so if you use default paths and custom file naming, you'll be ok, but
    if you change the path you'll have to supply it using other WordPress
    functions.
