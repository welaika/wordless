.. _Server:

Development environment
=======================

Starting by saying that with a

.. code-block:: bash

    yarn run server

you should be up and running, let's see in depth what happens behind
the scenes.

_________

YARN
####

``yarn run`` (or simply ``yarn scriptName``) will search for a ``scripts``
section inside your ``package.json`` file and will execute the matched script.

.. literalinclude:: /../../wordless/theme_builder/vanilla_theme/package.json
    :lines: 9-17
    :language: javascript
    :caption: package.json
    :emphasize-lines: 2

``yarn server`` will run ``nf start``, where ``nf`` is the Node Foreman
executable.

Foreman
#######

`Node Foreman`_ (``nf``) could do complex things, but Wordless uses it just
to be able to launch multiple processes when ``server`` is fired.

.. _Node Foreman: https://www.npmjs.com/package/foreman

.. literalinclude:: /../../wordless/theme_builder/vanilla_theme/Procfile
    :caption: Procfile

As you can see, each line has a simple named command. Each command will be
launched and *foreman* will:

* run all the listed processes
* collect all STDOUTs from processes and print theme as one - with fancyness
* when stopped (CTRL-C) it will stop all of the processes

wp server
#########

Launched by ``nf``. Is a default *WP-CLI* command.

We are invoking it within a theme directory, but it will climb up directories
until it finds a ``wp-config.php`` file, then it will start a PHP server
on its default port (8080) and on the ``127.0.0.1`` address as per our config.

.. note::
    You can directly reach ``http://127.0.0.1:8080`` in you browser in order
    to reach wordpress, bypassing all the webpack *things* we're going to show
    below.

BrowserSync
###########

The only relevant **Webpack** part in this section is BrowserSync_. It will
start a web server at address ``127.0.0.1`` on port 3000.
This is where your browser will automatically go once launched.

.. literalinclude:: /../../wordless/theme_builder/vanilla_theme/webpack.config.coffee
    :lines: 70-76
    :language: coffeescript
    :caption: webpack.config.coffee

As you can see from the configuration, web requests will be proxy-ed to the
underlying ``wp server``.

Since *BrowserSync* is invoked through a Webpack plugin
(`browser-sync-webpack-plugin`_) we will benefit from automatic
**browser autoreloading** when assets are recompiled by Webpack itself.

The ``files`` option is there because ``.pug`` files are not compiled by
webpack, so we force watching those files too, thus calling autoreload on
template changes too.

.. seealso::
    :ref:`CompileStack` for other Webpack default configurations

.. note::
    *BrowserSync*'s UI will be reachable at ``http://127.0.0.1:3001`` as per
    default configuration.

.. warning::
    If you will develop with the WordPress backend in a tab, *BrowserSync* will
    ignorantly reload that tab aas well (all tabs opened on port 3000 actually).
    This could slow down your server. We advise to use the WordPress backend
    using port 8080 and thus bypassing *BrowserSync*.

MailHog
#######

MailHog is an email testing tool for developers:

* Configure your application to use MailHog for SMTP delivery
* View messages in the web UI, or retrieve them with the JSON API
* Optionally release messages to real SMTP servers for delivery

Wordless is configured to use it by default, so you can test mailouts from
your site, from WordPress and from your forms.

The UI will be at
http://localhost:8025 as per default configuration.

When you spawn ``yarn server``, you'll have an environment variable
exported thanks to the ``.env`` file:

.. literalinclude:: /../../wordless/theme_builder/vanilla_theme/.env
    :caption: .env

This will trigger the ``smtp.php`` initializer:

.. literalinclude:: /../../wordless/theme_builder/vanilla_theme/config/initializers/smtp.php
    :language: php
    :caption: config/initializers/smtp.php
