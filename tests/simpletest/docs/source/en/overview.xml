        <section name="summary" title="What is SimpleTest?">
            <p>
                The heart of SimpleTest is a testing framework built around
                test case classes.
                These are written as extensions of base test case classes,
                each extended with methods that actually contain test code.
                Each test method of a test case class is written to invoke
                various assertions that the developer expects to be true such as
                <code>assertEqual()</code>.
                If the expectation is correct, then a successful result is
                dispatched to the observing test reporter, but any failure
                or unexpected exception triggers an alert and a description
                of the mismatch.
                These test case declarations are transformed into executable
                test scripts by including a SimpleTest aurorun.php file.
            </p>
            <p>
                These documents apply to SimpleTest version 1.1, although we
                try hard to maintain compatibility between versions.
                If you get a test failure after an upgrade, check out the
                file &quot;HELP_MY_TESTS_DONT_WORK_ANYMORE&quot; in the
                simpletest directory to see if a feature you are using
                has since been deprecated and later removed.

                A <a local="unit_test_documentation">test case</a> looks like this...
<php><![CDATA[
<?php
require_once('simpletest/autorun.php');

class <strong>CanAddUp</strong> extends UnitTestCase {<strong>
    function testOneAndOneMakesTwo() {
        $this->assertEqual(1 + 1, 2);
    }</strong>
}
?>
]]></php>
                Tests are grouped into test cases, which are just
                PHP classes that extend <code>UnitTestCase</code>
                or <code>WebTestCase</code>.
                The tests themselves are just normal methods that start
                their name with the letters &quot;test&quot;.
                You can have as many test cases as you want in a test
                script and each test case can have as many test methods
                as it wants too.
            </p>
            <p>
                This test script is immediately runnable.
                You just invoke it on the command line like so...
<pre class="shell">
php adding_test.php
</pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                When run on the command line you should see something like...
<pre class="shell">
adding_test.php
OK
Test cases run: 1/1, Passes: 1, Failures: 0, Exceptions: 0
</pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                If you place it on a web server and point your
                web browser at it...
                <div class="demo">
                    <h1>adding_test.php</h1>
                    <div style="padding: 8px; margin-top: 1em; background-color: green; color: white;">1/1 test cases complete.
                    <strong>6</strong> passes, <strong>0</strong> fails and <strong>0</strong> exceptions.</div>
                </div>
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course this is a silly example.
                A more realistic example might be...

        $this->assertFalse(file_exists('my.log'));
        $log->message('Hello');
        $this->assertTrue(file_exists('my.log'));

            <p>
                This tool is designed for the developer.
                The target audience of this tool is anyone developing a small
                to medium PHP application, including developers new to
                unit and web regression testing.
                The core principles are ease of use first, with extendibility and
                essential features.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tests are written in the PHP language itself more or less
                as the application itself is built.
                The advantage of using PHP as the testing language is that
                there are no new languages to learn, testing can start straight away,
                and the developer can test any part of the code.
                Basically, all parts that can be accessed by the application code can also be
                accessed by the test code when they are in the same programming language.
            </p>
            <p>
                The simplest type of test case is the
                <a local="unit_tester_documentation">UnitTestCase</a>.
                This class of test case includes standard tests for equality,
                references and pattern matching.
                All these test the typical expectations of what you would
                expect the result of a function or method to be.
                This is by far the most common type of test in the daily
                routine of development, making up about 95% of test cases.
            </p>
            <p>
                The top level task of a web application though is not to
                produce correct output from its methods and objects, but
                to generate web pages.
                The <a local="web_tester_documentation">WebTestCase</a> class tests web
                pages.
                It simulates a web browser requesting a page, complete with
                cookies, proxies, secure connections, authentication, forms, frames and most
                navigation elements.
                With this type of test case, the developer can assert that
                information is present in the page and that forms and
                sessions are handled correctly.
            </p>

                and their expected point of release.
                I am afraid it is liable to change without warning, as meeting the

                then you should check-out the code from Sourceforge SVN directly.

                PHP 5 migration is complete, which means that only PHP 5.0.3+
                will be supported in SimpleTest version 1.1+.
                Earlier versions of SimpleTest are compatible with PHP 4.2 up to
                PHP 5 (non E_STRICT).
